                                    </h4>
                                    <p>A Nidhi Company is a type of Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) dedicated to
                                        lending or borrowing money to all its members as required. According to the
                                        Nidhi Rules, 2014, members can borrow money against tangible collateral such as
                                        property mortgage, gold, etc. Nidhi companies have to register under the
                                        Companies Act, 2013.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The conception of Nidhi Company was initiated to practice thrift amongst its
                                        members, receiving deposits and lending money for mutual benefit. A Nidhi
                                        company is regulated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs but it does not need
                                        to receive any license from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
                                    </p>
